Since the start of the year, one of my goals was to write a new blog post here every few weeks. Having a regular frequency in mind helped overcome a bit of the self-doubt that often holds me back from writing – the regular cadence becomes its own source of encouragement or motivation. 

My good friend Lucas’s [newsletter](https://buttondown.email/lchski) – [published every weekend](https://buttondown.email/lchski/archive) – was a big inspiration for starting this blog. To publish _something_, every week, and not worry too much about it being good or bad or perfect. (The newsletter’s title, “Hit or Miss” helps capture that, too.) Another [inspiration](https://sboots.ca/2019/11/05/hello-world/) was [David Eaves’ blog](https://eaves.ca/), with the subtitle, “if writing is a muscle, this is my gym.” Getting back into a regular, imperfect blogging routine is something I’m really looking forward to.

Although the blog here has been quiet, it turns out there’s been a lot of (metaphorical) exercise over the past couple months! For Lucas and I both, our day job has been [the busiest it’s ever been](https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/06/18/prime-minister-announces-new-mobile-app-help-notify-canadians-covid). Working on a product with more scale and visibility than our team’s past work has been exciting and daunting all at once. 

On that, and other things, there’ll be more to write in the weeks ahead. Hopefully even some semblance of a regular blogging cadence! In the meantime, I hope all of you are doing well and having a good summer despite the pandemic.
